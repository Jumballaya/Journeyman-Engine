# Journeyman Game Engine

This engine is for educational purposes and not meant to be a _real_ game engine. I hope you like it, and I hope you can learn something from it!

## Requirements

If you have CMake version >= 4.0.0:
```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
```
Some of the wasm3 packages require an older version of cmake.
